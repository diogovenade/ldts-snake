# LDTS - Project 1

## Description:
The game to be implemented in our project is going to be a recreation of the classic game "Snake". The main gameplay loop consists of the player controlling a snake in a 2D grid trying to eat fruits placed on said grid. As the player eats the fruits, the snake grows in size, making it more difficult to move it around the grid. The player loses if the head of the snake hits one of the edges of the grid or a part of its own body.
The game shall contain additional, optional features that alter the base game in order to make it more complex and entertaining.
