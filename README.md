# LDTS - Project 1: Snake

## Description:
The game implemented in our project is a recreation of the classic game "Snake". The player must control a snake in a grid and eat the fruit on the grid. When the fruit is eaten, another one pops up at a random position. As the player eats the fruits, the snake grows in size, making it more difficult to move it around the grid. The player loses if the head of the snake hits one of the edges of the grid, a part of its own body or an obstacle.

You can find a more detailed description containing details on the features, design patterns and UMLs [here](docs/README.md).
