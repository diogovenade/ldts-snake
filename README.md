# LDTS - Project 1: Snake

## Description:
The game to be implemented in our project is going to be a recreation of the classic game "Snake". The player must control a snake in a grid and eat the fruit on the grid. When the the fruit is eaten, another one pops up at a random position. As the player eats the fruits, the snake grows in size, making it more difficult to move it around the grid. The player loses if the head of the snake hits one of the edges of the grid or a part of its own body.

## List of features:
- A menu that allows the player to start and quit the game, as well as adjust speed and grid size through the settings;
- Movement using the arrow keys;
- "Game Over" conditions for when the player hits one of the edges of the grid or themselves;
- A score system that also records the current High Score.
